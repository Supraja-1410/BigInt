## ðŸ“š Features
- **Custom BigInt Type**: Represents big integers (up to 309 decimal digits) with dynamic memory allocation.
- **High-Precision Arithmetic**:
  - **Addition & Subtraction**: Digit-wise calculation with sign management.
  - **Multiplication**: Classical and optimized **Karatsuba** method for large numbers.
  - **Division**: Long division algorithm with robust error checking.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Overflow checks for operations exceeding 1024 bits.
  - Graceful handling of division by zero.
  - Validates user input to ensure correct number formats.
- **Dynamic Memory Management**: Allocates and frees memory efficiently, ensuring program stability.
- **Interactive Console Interface**: Provides a menu-driven interface for users to input large numbers and select operations.
